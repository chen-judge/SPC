## Environment ðŸ”§

Please install these requirements:
```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For inference, please also install vllm (we use version 0.6.6).



## Data ðŸ“š
Please find our training data and evaluation dataset [here](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jadge_connect_hku_hk/EkB9OYBHr_tGmGeJ5xxTncgBXFnln9nPP4jmCKNcQSSDIQ?e=oF7b6g).

`data_round0_sft_critic.json` is SFT data and `data_round2_rl_critic.json` is for round 2 RFT.

The three files in `data/eval` correspond to the datasets used for evaluating the critic.

## Checkpoints ðŸ’¼

We have uploaded the trained [SFT critic model](https://huggingface.co/judge/SPC-Critic-0/tree/main) (round 0) and [RL critic model](https://huggingface.co/judge/SPC-Critic-2/tree/main) (round 2) to Hugging Face!

## Reinforcement Finetuning ðŸ”¥
You can use the data we provided to update the SFT critic model to the round 2 critic model. 

Please modify the data and model paths in the script as needed before running it:
```RL
bash scripts/rl_critic.sh
```

## Evaluation ðŸš€
After obtaining a critic model, please set the paths to the dataset and the checkpoint in the following script to perform evaluation.

```eval
python3 eval/infer_batch.py
```
